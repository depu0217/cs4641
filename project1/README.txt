Project 1


I ran all of my analysis with Weka.

I used a bash script to call Weka from the command line. This automation helped me run large numbers of tasks quickly.

I used python to plot all of my data.

The data I used is in the project1/data folder.

All source code is in the project1/src folder.

All outputs from the java Weka commands are in the project1/output folder.

All plot generated from the python files are in the project1/plots folder.

Please email ynambiar3@gatech.edu if you have any questions.
